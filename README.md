# `libpel` - Para Extension Library

[![Open Para issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Para-Lang/Para)](https://github.com/Para-Lang/Para/issues)

This is the repository containing the library (Para Extension Library) for extensions and importable libraries,
that add extensive functionality for the base language. 

For now this is an empty repository, as the language is still in early development!

*For proper documentation and info on Para visit the main repo [here](https://github.com/Para-Lang/Para).
This also includes issues or requesting changes. These should be done on the main branch, while the issues
here will be maintainers-only*
